                            The first pillar of Islam is Prayer. Muslims are required to pray five times a day, every day at specific hours.
                            The second pillar of Islam is Fasting during the month of Ramadan. Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset and usually breakfast by eating dates and drinking milk. Non-Muslims should avoid eating and drinking in public during the month of Ramadan when Muslims fast
                            The third pillar of Islam is Shahada, meaning a profession of faith. This profession of faith has two distinct parts, which involve the belief in a unique God and the belief in the Holy prophet Muhammad.
                            The fourth pillar involves support of the needy, which is called Zakat. 
                            The final pillar is the pilgrimage to Mecca, which is mandatory for financially and physically capable adults."
