        The Emirate of Dubai is the second largest of the seven United Arab
        Emirates but has the biggest population at over 2.1 million inhabitants.
        Size has been synonymous with Dubai as it continues to build the first,
        largest and the biggest constructions in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dubai's dynamics are always transient and ever-changing with its
        constant urge to construct something better and bigger than the
        previous. If there was a Palm Island, Nakheel thought of the World
        Island. Burj Al Arab seemed too timid when Burj Khalifa cropped up,
        distancing itself to being a loner in the crowd. Dubai constantly dwells
        in a suppressive competition with itself trying to magnetize tourists to
        a dreamy world of attractions and unheard of luxuries.
      </p>
      <p>
        The emirate's scoring points lie in its entrepreneurial abilities to
        create the inconceivable found in its tourist attractions, landmarks,
        shopping centres, parks, nightlife and hotels. Although it strictly
        safeguards its traditional practices, it allows space for other
        religions to breathe, a rare quality amongst the conservative Arab
        world. Thankfully, it has been successful in shielding itself from
        extremism, much-needed for it to survive. Today, Dubai has emerged as a
        cosmopolitan metropolis that has grown steadily to become a global city
        and a business and cultural hub of the Middle East and the Persian Gulf
        region.

        abundance of attractions, activities, exhibitions, shopping and
        nightlife. Here's a top list of things to do when holidaying in Dubai.
