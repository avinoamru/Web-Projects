            Albert Einstein (14 March 1879–18 April 1955) was a German-born
            scientist. He worked on theoretical
            <img src="albert_einstein.jpg" alt="Albert Einstein take out his tounge" align="right" height="400"
                width="300" />
            physics.<br />
            He developed the theory of relativity.[3][6] He received the Nobel Prize
            in Physics in 1921 for theoretical physics.<br />
            His famous equation is (E=mc^2) (E = energy, m = mass, c = speed of
            light).

        <p>
            At the beginning of his career, Einstein did not think that Newtonian
            mechanics was enough to reconcile (bring together) the laws of classical
            mechanics and the laws of the electromagnetic field. <br />
            Between 1902–1909 he developed the special theory of relativity to
            correct that.<br />
            Einstein also thought that Isaac Newton's idea of gravity was not
            completely correct. <br />
            So, he extended his ideas on special relativity to include gravity. In
            1916 he published a paper on general relativity with his theory of
            gravitation.

            In 1933, Einstein was visiting the United States. In Germany, Adolf
            Hitler and the Nazis came to power.<br />
            Einstein, being of Jewish ethnicity, did not return to Germany due to
            the Hitler’s anti-Semitic policies.<br />
            He lived in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940. On
            the beginning of World War II, he sent a letter to President Franklin
            D.<br />

            Roosevelt explaining to him that Germany was in the process of making a
            nuclear weapon; so Einstein recommended that<br />
            the US should also make one. This led to the Manhattan Project, and the
            US became the first nation in history to create and<br />
            use the atomic bomb (not on Germany though but Japan). Einstein and
            other physicists like Richard Feynman who <br />worked on the Manhattan
            project later regretted that the bomb was used on Japan.

            Einstein lived in Princeton and was one of the first members invited to
            the Institute for Advanced Study, where he worked for the remainder of
            his life.<br />
            He is widely considered one of the greatest scientists of all time.<br />
            His contributions helped lay the foundations for all modern branches of
            physics, including quantum mechanics and relativity.
